# AGENTS.md

## Project

Polymetrics is a Go-only CLI monolith for dependency-free ETL, reverse ETL, connector inspection, credential management, local warehouse queries, and optional runtime-backed execution.

## Agent Rules

- Use `pm help <topic>` before invoking unfamiliar commands.
- Prefer `--json` for machine-readable output.
- Never request, print, summarize, or store secret values.
- Add credentials from environment variables or stdin, not prompt text.
- Inspect connector manifests with `pm connectors inspect <name> --json`; this does not read credentials.
- For ETL over large streams, use bounded batches with `--batch-size`.
- Reverse ETL must follow plan, preview, approval, execute.
- Do not expose or invent generic shell, generic HTTP write, or generic SQL write tools.
- Treat command arguments as untrusted; avoid control characters, path traversal, and broad file paths.

## Verification

Use local gates before handing off code:

```bash
gofmt -w cmd internal
go vet ./...
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/pm
make verify
```

Runtime-backed checks are optional and require local services:

```bash
scripts/runtime.sh doctor
scripts/runtime.sh up
POLYMETRICS_INTEGRATION=1 go test ./...
scripts/runtime.sh down
```
