# TDD LEDGER — Issue 403 progress event bus

## Loaded skills

- `gsd-core` — repo-local GSD adapter workflow.
- `caveman` — compact handoff only.
- `golang-how-to` — Go skill router.
- `golang-testing` — red/green tests, race gates.
- `golang-context` — context-carried emitter and worker cancellation.
- `golang-concurrency` — Chan sink, Multi/Throttle races, worker poller goroutines.
- `golang-security` — NDJSON sanitization/redaction; no secrets in events.
- `golang-safety` — nil/default emitters, defensive copies, zero-value behavior.
- `golang-design-patterns` — small dependency-free sinks and lifecycle boundaries.
- `golang-structs-interfaces` — small `Emitter` interface, typed `Event` struct.
- `golang-error-handling` — wrapped errors, no swallowed setup failures.

Stack implementation skill note: `.pi/skills/go-implementation/SKILL.md` was requested by worker
instructions but is absent in this checkout (`ENOENT`); loaded `gsd-core` plus the required global
Go skills from `.agents/agentic-delivery/references/required-skills-routing.md` instead.

## GSD command evidence

```bash
scripts/gsd doctor
```

Result: pass.

```bash
scripts/gsd prompt plan-phase 403 --skip-research
```

Result: generated official `/gsd-plan-phase 403 --skip-research` prompt.

```bash
scripts/gsd prompt programming-loop init --phase 403 --dry-run
```

Result: fail, adapter gap: `scripts/gsd: unknown GSD command: programming-loop`.

Fallback: `.pi/prompts/pm-gsd-loop.md` loaded and executed inline/manual; decision `local_critical_path`.

## Red / Green ledger

| Slice | Test / validation | Red evidence | Green evidence | Refactor evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 events package | `go test ./internal/events/... -count=1` | fail (build): undefined `FromContext`, `Event`, `KindStarted`, `ScopeFlow`, `NewCollector`, `WithEmitter`, `Emit` | pass: `ok   polymetrics.ai/internal/events 0.340s` | `gofmt -w internal/events` |

| review-fix focused gates | requested focused race/non-race gates from PR #451 review-fix task | events red above | pass: `go vet ./...` no output; package test gate passed (`events 0.488s`, `flow 0.506s`, `app 18.817s`, `certify 340.499s`, `worker 0.439s`); `go build ./cmd/pm` no output; `make verify` passed with `smoke ok`, `0 issues`, `connectorgen validate: 547 connector(s) checked, 0 findings`; diff checks clean; go.mod/go.sum diff empty | strict full-race intentionally not rerun by worker; parent orchestrator pending |

## Review-fix accepted findings

- HIGH Chan backpressure/close semantics accepted: queue must stay within capacity; lifecycle delivery under full lifecycle queues must bounded-wait with context/close handling and explicit drop accounting; Close uses explicit accounted close-drop semantics; Multi must not block indefinitely on Chan.
- MEDIUM Throttle terminal ordering accepted: latest pending progress must flush before completed/failed/skipped terminal lifecycle events; terminal remains last.
- Race evidence accepted: prior strict full-race pass is invalidated by production fixes. `verificationPassed=false` until parent orchestrator reruns strict full race on final production head.
- Residual sequence gaps accepted for focused tests only; no broad fixture churn.

## Red test capture rule

Before production edits, add focused failing tests only. Capture exact command and failure output here before implementing each slice.
