## Declared Phase Equivalent

The user/parent explicitly replaced generic repository-wide verification for this sub-worker with
the issue-focused and complete Shepherd TypeScript gates below. Therefore `verificationPassed`
means every declared command here passed; it does not claim parent-level Go/connector verification.

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Focused AgentSession/tool-policy tests | pass | 22 passed, 0 failed, exit 0 |
| Complete `.pi/extensions/shepherd/*.test.ts` suite | pass | 159 passed, 0 failed, exit 0 |
| Strict no-emit TypeScript against installed Pi 0.80.6 types | pass | owned production/tests plus all Shepherd production `.ts`; exit 0 |
| Supported offline Pi extension/RPC smoke | pass | explicit 0.80.6 binary, `PI_OFFLINE=1`, RPC `get_commands`; `true`, exit 0 |
| `git diff --check` | pass | exit 0 |
| Owned-scope diff check | pass | every base diff path matches issue #475 production/test/phase scope |

## Explicit Boundary

Not run in this lane by policy: `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...`, `go build ./cmd/pm`, `make verify`,
connector certification, and all other repository-wide Go/connector gates. These remain parent
integration and GitHub CI responsibilities. This is an intentional verification partition, not a
skip, pass, or failure.

## Model / Dependency / Safety Baseline

- Installed Pi: `0.80.6`.
- Required route: `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`; `high` implementation/correction, `xhigh` all other
  roles.
- New dependencies: none permitted or planned.
- Live auth/model/network/credential checks: not run and not needed.

## Commands And Results

```bash
node --test .pi/extensions/shepherd/agent-session-runtime.test.ts \
  .pi/extensions/shepherd/tool-policy.test.ts
# 22 passed, 0 failed

node --test .pi/extensions/shepherd/*.test.ts
# 159 passed, 0 failed
```

TypeScript used the already-installed TypeScript 5.9.3 compiler and explicit Pi 0.80.6 package/type
roots with:

```text
--noEmit --strict --target ES2024 --module NodeNext --moduleResolution NodeNext
--allowImportingTsExtensions --skipLibCheck
```

It passed both the owned production/test input list and every non-test
`.pi/extensions/shepherd/*.ts` production file. `--skipLibCheck` suppresses unrelated declaration
issues inside the globally installed SDK dependency graph; all Shepherd inputs remain under
`--strict`, and the new runtime imports Pi 0.80.6 `AgentSessionEvent` and
`CreateAgentSessionOptions` directly.

The supported smoke used the explicit pinned binary because the ambient PATH changed during the
lane and now resolves another Pi installation:

```bash
printf '{"id":"commands","type":"get_commands"}\n' |
  PI_OFFLINE=1 /Users/karthiksivadas/.nvm/versions/node/v24.13.1/bin/pi \
    --mode rpc --no-session --approve \
    --no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-context-files \
    -e .pi/extensions/shepherd/index.ts
```

The explicit binary reports `0.80.6`; the RPC registration assertion returned `true`.

## Deviations

- `manual_gsd_fallback`: the healthy repo adapter has no `programming-loop` registry entry.
- Ambient PATH drift: default `pi` resolved to 0.80.6 initially and 0.80.10 at final verification.
  All authoritative pinned checks use the unchanged explicit 0.80.6 binary/package/types.
- No Shepherd prompt asset file was needed beyond the owned typed `role-prompts.ts` builder; it
  generates the trusted role prompt and schema envelope without widening the allowed scope.
