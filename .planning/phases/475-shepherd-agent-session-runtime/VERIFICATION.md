# Verification — Issue #475

## Declared Phase Equivalent

The user/parent explicitly replaced generic repository-wide verification for this sub-worker with
the issue-focused and complete Shepherd TypeScript gates below. Therefore `verificationPassed`
means every declared command here passed; it does not claim parent-level Go/connector verification.

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Focused AgentSession/tool-policy tests | pending | — |
| Complete `.pi/extensions/shepherd/*.test.ts` suite | pending | — |
| Strict no-emit TypeScript against installed Pi 0.80.6 types | pending | — |
| Supported offline Pi extension/RPC smoke | pending | — |
| `git diff --check` | pending | — |
| Owned-scope diff check | pending | — |

## Explicit Boundary

Not run in this lane by policy: `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...`, `go build ./cmd/pm`, `make verify`,
connector certification, and all other repository-wide Go/connector gates. These remain parent
integration and GitHub CI responsibilities. This is an intentional verification partition, not a
skip, pass, or failure.

## Model / Dependency / Safety Baseline

- Installed Pi: `0.80.6`.
- Required route: `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`; `high` implementation/correction, `xhigh` all other
  roles.
- New dependencies: none permitted or planned.
- Live auth/model/network/credential checks: not run and not needed.
