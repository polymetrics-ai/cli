# Summary: #478

Status: implementation in progress.

The plan-first checkpoint fixes the immutable base, owned file boundary, strict RED→GREEN→REFACTOR
sequence, fake-only transport policy, exact-head review policy, human gates, and coordinator-bounded
verification matrix. The test-only RED checkpoint is now captured: all three matching test files
fail because their production modules are intentionally absent.
