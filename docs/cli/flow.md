NAME
  pm flow - plan, preview, run, list, and inspect multi-step flows

SYNOPSIS
  pm flow plan --file flow.json [--json]
  pm flow preview --file flow.json [--json]
  pm flow run --file flow.json [--force] [--json] [--progress ndjson]
  pm flow status <name> [--flows-dir .polymetrics/flows] [--json]
  pm flow list [--flows-dir .polymetrics/flows] [--json]

DESCRIPTION
  Flow manifests compose sync, query, rlm, and action steps. Dependencies are
  inferred from in/out warehouse tables. RLM steps reuse pm rlm analyzers and
  may reference a spec path relative to the flow manifest file.

PROGRESS
  Add --progress ndjson to stream sanitized flow progress events to stderr.
  Stdout remains the final human line or single JSON envelope. On failures,
  stderr may also include the final error diagnostic after progress events.
  CI, PM_NO_TUI, --plain, --no-input, pipes, and TERM=dumb keep the plain path.

RLM STEP EXAMPLE
  {
    "id": "score",
    "kind": "rlm",
    "spec": "lead-score.json",
    "mode": "fixture",
    "in": [],
    "out": ["lead_scores"]
  }

SECURITY
  Read-only sync, query, and rlm steps run through existing app primitives.
  Action steps remain approval-gated.

EXIT STATUS
  0 success
  1 runtime error
  2 usage error
